### Core Intelligence (Phases 1–11)
- Repository, vision, collector skeletons, local economic/gold data
- CPI/Gold LessonBuilder, Lesson Summary Aggregator, Knowledge Memory
- Evidence-Backed Brain, Feature Extraction Engine
- NetworkX Knowledge Graph, Evidence Query and Ranking
- Reasoning Engine, Decision Engine, Learning Engine
- End-to-End Inference Pipeline
- Economic, Temporal, Causal Intelligence Layers
- US10Y Yield Context Enrichment
- CPI + Yield Multi-Factor Knowledge Records
- Context Comparison Report
- Knowledge Integrity & Versioning (Provenance, LineageRegistry, VersionedStore)
- Intelligence Orchestration Engine (13 tests)
- Adaptive Intelligence Policy Engine (6 tests)
- Institutional Intelligence Validation (10 scenarios, 8 PASS / 2 WARNING)
- ADR-0004 Final Closure (canonical path, lineage normalization, clean pytest)
- Knowledge Chain Completion (bidirectional lineage, 2 end-to-end tests)
- Project Stabilization (dead code removal, import cleanup, documents sync)
- 786 tests passing (post-stabilization)

### Capability Expansion (Phases 13–21)
- DXY Context Layer (13.1)
- Economic Calendar Connector (13.2)
- Multi-Event Knowledge Comparison (13.3)
- NFPEvent Implementation (14.1)
- FOMC Calendar (14.2), FOMC Event (14.3)
- GDP Event, PPI Event, Macro Regime (14.4)
- PMI Event (14.5)
- FOMC Minutes NLP (15.1)
- News Data Pipeline (15.2), News Sentiment Engine (15.3)
- Technical Indicators Engine (15.4)
- Time Series Forecasting (16.1)
- Risk Intelligence Phase 17 (17.1–17.5, 117 tests)
- Phase 20 Hardening (20.1–20.5)
  - Determinism Hardening, Data Integrity (FrozenDict, atomic writes)
  - Performance Hardening (GraphBuilder indexed)
  - Maintainability Hardening (orchestrator module split)
  - Packaging Hardening (pyproject.toml audit)
  - 253 tests across 20.x–21.x
- Phase 21 Paper Trading (21.1–21.3)
  - VirtualPortfolio, Slippage & Commission, Execution Engine
  - 167 tests across 21.x, 1551 total (all passing)

### Production Hardening & Lineage Activation (Phase 22)
- **AUR-FINAL-001**: Fixed look-ahead gap in `_replay_event_release_by_release`
- **AUR-FINAL-002**: Wired `reasoning_horizon`/`reasoning_condition` through legacy pipeline (3 tests)
- **AUR-FINAL-003**: Verified INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE guard already functional
- **AUR-FINAL-004**: Added `min_evidence_count` wiring (2 tests)
- **AUR-FINAL-005**: Verified `compare_context` validation already correct
- **LINEAGE-PROD-DISCONNECT**: LineageRegistry created/passed in `_build_legacy_pipeline` (2 tests)
- **Production Hardening Validation**: 1584/1584 pass, 0 regressions, READY
- **Full Reproducibility Assessment**: Verdict A — Fully deterministic
  - All IDs content-derived (no uuid4)
  - All RNG uses fixed seed 42
  - Only cosmetic timestamps differ across runs

### Phase 21.3 Paper Trading Execution Engine (COMPLETE)
- Created `src/execution/execution_engine.py` — `ExecutionEngine` class with `evaluate()` method
- `ExecutionDecision` enum: `EXECUTE`, `REJECT`, `HOLD`
- Respects RiskDecision: `halt`/`delay` → REJECT, no portfolio mutation
- Applies slippage + commission on execute
- Deterministic, no broker/MT5/forecasting/reasoning

| Sprint | Tests |
|--------|-------|
| AUR-FINAL Fixes | 5 |
| LINEAGE-PROD Activation | 2 |
| 20.1–20.5 Hardening | 253 |
| 21.1–21.3 Paper Trading | 167 |

| Total Tests | 1593 |

## Next

### Institutional Readiness (Phase 23 — Active)
- **OOS Validation (Gate 6)**: Real CPI/US10Y out-of-sample evaluation using expanding-window chronological split
- **Immutable Persistence (Gate 5)**: Atomic writes, content-addressed versions
- **CI Pipeline (Gate 7)**: Clean CI from fresh clone

No new intelligence capability will be added before OOS validation demonstrates measurable predictive value.
